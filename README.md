## Introduction

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

## Installation

Mac OS X and Linux comes pre installed with python. Windows users can download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

To install IPython run,

    $ pip install ipython[all]
    
This will install all the necessary dependencies for the notebook, qtconsole, tests etc.

### Installation from unofficial distributions

Installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome. Anaconda and Canopy comes pre packaged with all the necessary python libraries and also IPython.

#### Anaconda

Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Anaconda is completely free and includes more than 300 python packages. Both python 2.7 and 3.4 options are available.

#### Canopy

Download Canopy from https://store.enthought.com/downloads/#default

Canopy has a premium version which offers 300+ python packages. But the free version works just fine. Canopy as of now supports only 2.7 but it comes with its own text editor and IPython environment.

## Launching IPython Notebook

From the terminal

    ipython notebook

In Canopy and Anaconda, Open the respective terminals and execute the above.

## How to learn from this resource?

You can download the pdf copy from here : [Get Started with Python](https://github.com/rajathkumarmp/Python-Lectures/blob/master/Python.pdf)

It is better to download all the ipython notebooks from this repository https://github.com/rajathkumarmp/Python-Lectures and learn it on the notebook itself rather than having to refer to a pdf.

Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them

    Cell > All Output > Clear
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.
